# Used as a default to seed config/.env which
# enables you to use environment variables to configure
# the aspects of your application that vary by
# environment.
#
# Having this file in production is considered a **SECURITY RISK** and also decreases
# the bootstrap performance of your application.
#
# To use this file, first copy it into `config/.env`. Also ensure the related
# code block for loading this file is uncommented in `config/bootstrap.php`
#
# In development .env files are parsed by PHP
# and set into the environment. This provides a simpler
# development workflow over standard environment variables.
